# 🕵️ Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack Lab

> "In a world where trust is protocol-deep, I decided to sit in the middle."

## ⚔️ Objective
Simulate and understand real-world **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attacks in a controlled lab environment.  
Focus was placed on **intercepting and analyzing traffic** using classic techniques.

## 🧪 Tools Used
- 🧷 **Ettercap** – for sniffing and intercepting traffic in an ARP-spoofed network
- 🧪 **Wireshark** – for live traffic analysis and protocol inspection
- 🛜 Local VM setup – Kali Linux with a bridged Windows 10 target

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Network topology configuration for ARP spoofing
- Real-time packet interception between two devices
- Identifying unencrypted credentials and session data
- Analyzing protocol behavior during MITM scenarios

## 📝 Artifacts
- Lab documentation outlining setup and execution
- Screenshots demonstrating traffic interception
- Observations and mitigation strategies noted
